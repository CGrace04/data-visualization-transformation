Specifically, let's investigate how many `new` games were sold versus how many `used` games were sold by creating a barplot. Add the following correct `geom` to make a barplot of `cond`.\n\n```{webr-r}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = cond)) + \n  #add geom here\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\nadd `geom_bar()` to the following code above to create a barplot of `cond`.\n:::\n\nNext, let's fill in the bars by the shipping method each game was shipped with (`ship_sp`).\n\n```{webr-r}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = cond , fill = ...)) + \n   geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Expected Result\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = cond , fill = ship_sp)) + \n   geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mario-data-visualization_files/figure-html/plot-fill-solution-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe code above uses `fill` to color the segments of the boxplot by another categorical variable. Below, we change `fill` to `color`. What happens? Why?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = cond , color = ship_sp)) + \n   geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mario-data-visualization_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<label>Answer:</label> <br>\n\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea rows=\"4\" cols=\"50\">\n</textarea>\n```\n\n<br><br>\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n`fill` defines the color in which the `geom` is filled in with, while color defines the color in which the `geom` is outlined. A special exception to this is with scatterplots, where the dots are not treated as shapes to be filled in, and instead are filled in by color.\n:::\n\n## Count vs Proportion\n\nUp to this point, our bar plot has counted up the number of observations for each condition of game, and has been segmented by the count of shipping method. Perhaps it is easier to compare shipping method across condition of game if we looked at the proportion of shipping method within each game. This can be achieved using `position = \"fill\"` in the `geom` statement. Alter the code below so that it includes `position = fill`, and comment on the relationship between condition and shipping method. \n\n```{webr-r}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = cond , fill = ship_sp)) + \n   geom_bar()\n```\n\n<label>Answer:</label> <br>\n\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea rows=\"4\" cols=\"50\">\n</textarea>\n```\n\n<br><br>\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = cond , fill = ship_sp)) + \n   geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mario-data-visualization_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIt appears that new mario games were mainly shipped using upsGround, while used mario games were shipped using standard shipping.\n:::\n\n# Relationships between numerical and categorical variables\n\nUp to this point, we have been visualizing the relationship between categorical variables. What if we wanted to look at the relationships between different types of variables? \n\n# Boxplots \n\nOne way we can investigate the relationship between different types of variables is to create a boxplot. Below, we are going to create a boxplot using `geom_boxplot` between the variables `cond` and `total_pr`. What information can we gather from the boxplots? \n\n```{webr-r}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = cond , y = total_pr)) + \n   # insert geom here\n```\n\n<label>Answer:</label> <br>\n\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea rows=\"4\" cols=\"50\">\n</textarea>\n```\n\n<br><br>\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = cond , y = total_pr)) + \n   geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mario-data-visualization_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can infer that the median total price for new mario games is higher for the new condition versus the used condition. There appears to be one outlier in new condition, and four outliers in the used condition. The IQR of the new condition is slightly larger than the used condition. \n:::\n\n# Violin plot \n\nA violin plot is a lot like a box plot, but also shows us information about the density of the quantitative variable. Below, we have a violin plot that again shows the relationship between the condition of the Mario game, and the total price of the game (cost + shipping). Describe the relationship below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = cond , y = total_pr)) + \n   geom_violin()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mario-data-visualization_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<label>Answer:</label> <br>\n\n\n```{=html}\n<textarea rows=\"4\" cols=\"50\">\n</textarea>\n```\n\n<br><br>\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\nIt appears that there is a higher density of new games at a higher price than used games. Used games appear to have two potential outliers higher than any new game.\n:::\n\n## Ridge plots \n\nRidge plots, similar to violin plots, shows the distribution of a numeric variable across the levels of a categorical variable. In order to make this plot, we will use `geom_density_ridges`. Please add this geom to the following code below to make the ridge plots. Within this geom, set alpha equal to 0.5. \n\n```{webr-r}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = total_pr , y = cond, fill = cond, color = cond)) + \n   # insert geom here\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmario |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = total_pr , y = cond, fill = cond, color = cond)) + \n   geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 2.68\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mario-data-visualization_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Quiz \n\n1. Select all the apply. What information can you gather from a boxplot \na. median \nb. mean \nc. IQR \nd. standard deviation \ne. mode \n\n2. Below, we have stacked barplots using the `mario` data set from your exercise. This plot looks at the relationship between condition of game, and the shipping method the seller used to send the game to the customer. Use this plot to answer the following questions. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mario-data-visualization_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat argument is used to change the y-axis to proportion? \n\n- `color` \n\n- `fill` \n\n- `shape` \n\n- `transform` \n\n3. Across both conditions of game, which shipping method had the lowest total? \n\n- `firstClass` \n\n- `media` \n\n- `other` \n\n- `parcel` \n\n- `priority` \n\n- `standard` \n\n- `ups3Day` \n\n- `upsGround` \n\n- `not enough information` \n\n4. Which shipping method had the most used mario games compared to new mario games? \n\n- `firstClass` \n\n- `media` \n\n- `other` \n\n- `parcel` \n\n- `priority` \n\n- `standard` \n\n- `ups3Day` \n\n- `upsGround` \n\n- `not enough information` \n\n5. True or False: There was a larger count of used Mario games shipped using priority than used Mario games that were shipped standard. \n\n6. True or False: The y-axis that shows relative proportion must always be on a scale from 0 to 1. \n\n\n",
