# Learning goals

## By the end of the course, you will be able to...

-   gain insights from data

-   gain insights from data, using modern programming tools and techniques

-   [gain insights from data, using modern programming tools and techniques, reproducibly with literate programming]{.pink-bold}

-   gain insights from data, using modern programming tools and techniques, reproducibly with literate programming and version control

# Reproducible data analysis

## Reproducibility checklist

::: task
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
:::

. . .

<br>

**Short-term goals:**

-   Tables and figures must be reproducible from the code and data
-   The code should actually do what you think it does
-   In addition to what was done, it should be clear why it was done

. . .

**Long-term goals:**

-   The code should be usable for other data
-   The code should be extendable to do other things

## Toolkit for reproducibility

-   Scriptability → R

-   Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) → Quarto

-   Version control → Git / GitHub

# Quarto

::: incremental
-   Open-source scientific and technical publishing system
-   Fully reproducible reports -- each time you render the analysis is ran from the beginning
-   Code goes in chunks narrative goes outside of chunks
-   A visual editor for a familiar, Google Docs/MS Word-like editing experience

## Environments

::: callout-important
The environment of your Quarto document is separate from the Console!
:::

Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work with Quarto!

## How will we use Quarto?

::: incremental
-   Every code along is a Quarto document

-   You'll always have a template Quarto document to start with

-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
