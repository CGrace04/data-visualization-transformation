# Coding out loud {.section-break}

## Step 1

**Start with the `penguins` data frame**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(
  data = penguins
  )
```

## Step 2

Start with the `penguins` data frame, **map bill depth to the x-axis**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm)
  )
```

## Step 3

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis **and map bill length to the y-axis.**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm
    )
  )
```

## Step 4

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
**Represent each observation with a point**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm
    )
  ) +
  geom_point()
```

## Step 5

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point **and map species to the color of each point.**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm,
    color = species
    )
  ) +
  geom_point()
```

## Step 6

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
**Title the plot "Bill depth and length"**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm,
    color = species
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length"
  )
```

## Step 7

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
Title the plot "Bill depth and length", **add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins"**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm,
    color = species
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins"
  )
```

## Step 8

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", **label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm,
    color = species
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Bill depth (mm)", 
    y = "Bill length (mm)"
  )
```

## Step 9

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, **label the legend "Species"**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm,
    color = species
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Bill depth (mm)", 
    y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Species"
  )
```

## Step 10

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, label the legend "Species", **and add a caption for the data source.**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm,
    color = species
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Bill depth (mm)", 
    y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Species",
    caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package"
  )
```

## Step 11

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, label the legend "Species", and add a caption for the data source.
**Finally, use a discrete color scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of color blindness.**

```{r}
#| label: step-11
#| output-location: column

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm,
    color = species
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Bill depth (mm)", 
    y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Species",
    caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package"
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

## Plot

```{r}
#| ref.label: step-11
#| echo: false
```

## Code

```{r}
#| ref.label: step-11
#| fig-show: hide
```

## Narrative

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.

Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.

Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, label the legend "Species", and add a caption for the data source.

Finally, use a discrete color scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of color blindness.

## Argument names

You can omit the names of first two arguments when building plots with `ggplot()`.

```{r}
#| label: named-args
#| eval: false

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
                     y = bill_length_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

```{r}
#| label: not-named-args
#| eval: false

ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

# Aesthetics {.section-break}

## Aesthetics options

Commonly used characteristics of plotting characters that can be **mapped to a specific variable** in the data are

-   `color`
-   `shape`
-   `size`
-   `alpha` (transparency)

## color

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

## Shape

Mapped to a different variable than `color`

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = island)) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

## Shape

Mapped to same variable as `color`

```{r}
#| output-location: column
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

## Size

```{r}
#| output-location: column

ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species,
           size = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

## Alpha

```{r}
#| output-location: column

ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
           y = bill_length_mm,
           color = species,
           shape = species,
           size = body_mass_g,
           alpha = flipper_length_mm)) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

## Mapping vs. setting

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Mapping:**
```{r}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm,
           size = body_mass_g, #<<
           alpha = flipper_length_mm)) + #<<
  geom_point()
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Setting:**
```{r warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5)
```
:::
:::

## Mapping vs. setting

-   **Mapping:** Determine the size, alpha, etc. of points based on the values of a variable in the data
    -   goes into `aes()`
-   **Setting:** Determine the size, alpha, etc. of points **not** based on the values of a variable in the data
    -   goes into `geom_*()` (this was `geom_point()` in the previous example, but we'll learn about other geoms soon!)

# Faceting

## Faceting

-   Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data
-   Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data

.panelset\[ .panel\[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r ref.label = "facet", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
```

.panel\[.panel-name[Code]

```{r facet, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ island) #<<
```

## Various ways to facet

.question\[ In the next few slides describe what each plot displays.
Think about how the code relates to the output.

**Note:** The plots in the next few slides do not have proper titles, axis labels, etc. because we want you to figure out what's happening in the plots.
But you should always label your plots!

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ sex) #<<
```

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(sex ~ species) #<<
```

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ species) #<<
```

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ species) #<<
```

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ species, ncol = 2) #<<
```

## Faceting summary

-   `facet_grid()`:
    -   2d grid
    -   `rows ~ cols`
    -   use `.` for no split
-   `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped according to number of rows and columns specified or available plotting area

## Facet and color

.pull-left-narrow\[

```{r facet-color-legend, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(
  penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
      y = bill_length_mm, 
      color = species)) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ sex) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() #<<
```

.pull-right-wide\[

```{r ref.label = "facet-color-legend", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
```

## Face and color, no legend

.pull-left-narrow\[

```{r facet-color-no-legend, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(
  penguins,
