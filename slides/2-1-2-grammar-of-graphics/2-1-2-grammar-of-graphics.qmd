# Coding out loud {.section-break}

## Step 1

**Start with the `penguins` data frame**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "|1,3|2"
ggplot(
  data = penguins
  )
```

## Step 2

Start with the `penguins` data frame, **map bill depth to the x-axis**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm)
  )
```

## Step 3

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis **and map bill length to the y-axis.**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "4-5"
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm
    )
  )
```

## Step 4

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
**Represent each observation with a point**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| warning: false
#| code-line-numbers: "8"
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm
    )
  ) +
  geom_point()
```

## Step 5

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point **and map species to the color of each point.**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| warning: false
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_depth_mm,
    y = bill_length_mm,
    color = species
    )
  ) +
  geom_point()
```

## Step 6

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
**Title the plot "Bill depth and length"**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| warning: false
#| code-line-numbers: "|6,8|7"
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length"
  )
```

## Step 7

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
Title the plot "Bill depth and length", **add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins"**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 7
#| code-line-numbers: "8"
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins"
  )
```

## Step 8

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", **label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 7
#| code-line-numbers: "9-10"
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Bill depth (mm)", 
    y = "Bill length (mm)"
  )
```

## Step 9

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, **label the legend "Species"**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 7
#| code-line-numbers: "10"
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Bill depth (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Species"
  )
```

## Step 10 {.smaller}

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, label the legend "Species", **and add a caption for the data source.**

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 7
#| code-line-numbers: "11"
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Bill depth (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Species",
    caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package"
  )
```

## Step 11 {.smaller}

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.
Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.
Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, label the legend "Species", and add a caption for the data source.
**Finally, use a discrete color scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of color blindness.**

```{r}
#| label: step-11
#| output-location: column
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 7
#| code-line-numbers: "13"
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Bill depth (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Species",
    caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package"
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

## Plot

```{r}
#| ref.label: step-11
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 10
```

## Code

```{r}
#| ref.label: step-11
#| fig-show: hide
#| warning: false
```

## Narrative

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.

Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.

Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, label the legend "Species", and add a caption for the data source.

Finally, use a discrete color scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of color blindness.
