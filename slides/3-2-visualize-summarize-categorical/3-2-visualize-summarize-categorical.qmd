## Number of variables involved

::: incremental
-   Univariate data analysis - distribution of single variable
-   Bivariate data analysis - relationship between two variables
-   Multivariate data analysis - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others
:::

## Types of variables

::: incremental
-   **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.
-   If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

# Data

## Data: Lending Club

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Thousands of loans made through the Lending Club, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/lending-club.png)
:::
:::

::: incremental
-   Not all loans are created equal -- ease of getting a loan depends on (apparent) ability to pay back the loan

-   Data includes loans *made*, these are not loan applications

## Take a peek at data

```{r output.lines=18}
library(openintro)
glimpse(loans_full_schema)
```

## Selected variables

```{r}
loans <- loans_full_schema |>
  select(
    loan_amount, interest_rate, term, grade, 
    state, annual_income, homeownership, debt_to_income
  )
glimpse(loans)
```

| `term`           | The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months                                                |
| `grade`          | Loan grade, which takes a values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid |
| `state`          | US state where the borrower resides                                                                                    |

| `homeownership`  | Indicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or rents                                                   |
