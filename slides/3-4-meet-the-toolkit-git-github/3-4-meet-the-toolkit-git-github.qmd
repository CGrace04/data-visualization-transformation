-   Git is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word, on steroids
-   It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one

![](images/github-logo.png){fig-alt="GitHub logo" fig-align="center" width="150"}

-   GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better

-   We will use GitHub as a platform for your course projects

## Git and GitHub tips {.smaller}

There are many many git commands ... but there are a lot of them and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to push, commit, and pull

-   We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio, but if you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line.

## Before we begin - create GitHub account

Go to [Github](https://github.com/) and walk through the steps for creating an account.

Youâ€™ll need to choose a user name. I recommend reviewing the user name advice [here](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct#username-advice) before choosing a username.

# Tour: Git + GitHub + Configuration



## The project 
::: incremental
**Introduction** - contains more information about your data set and the research question(s) you are tasked to investigate.  

**Methods** - visualizations and summary statistics relevant to your research question(s). These should be accompanied with written descriptions.

**Discussion** - written summary to discuss your overall findings, and describe the key results from your analysis.
:::

## Set up your SSH key 

-   Go back to your RStudio container and type `credentials::ssh_setup_github()` into your console.

-   Open the browser when prompted, and paste your SSH key.

## Configure Git 

To do so, you will use the `use_git_config()` function from the usethis package.

```{r}
#| eval: false

usethis::use_git_config(
  user.name = "Elijah Meyer", 
  user.email = "elijahcoursera@gmail.com"
)
```
