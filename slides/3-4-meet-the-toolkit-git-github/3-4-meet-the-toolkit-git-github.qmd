# Version control

-   It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one

-   Git is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word, on steroids

-   GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better

-   We will use GitHub as a platform for your course projects

## Tour recap

Create a GitHub account

-   Go to [Github](https://github.com/) and walk through the steps for creating an account.

-   Youâ€™ll need to choose a user name.
    I recommend reviewing the user name advice [here](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct#username-advice) before choosing a username.

## Creating a new repository

-   [Project Repo](https://github.com/data-science-with-r/data-visualization-transformation-project)

![](images/template.png){fig-align="left"}

-   Make sure you are the owner

-   We recommend naming your repo the same name as the original

## Personal access token

-   Get a personal access token (PAT): `usethis::create_github_token()`

-   Copy your PAT

-   Insert PAT to configure Git, GitHub and R `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

```         
> gitcreds::gitcreds_set()

? Enter password or token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
-> Adding new credentials...
-> Removing credentials from cache...
-> Done.
```

## Git and GitHub tips

::: incremental
-   There are many many git commands ...
    but very few people know them all.
    99% of the time you will use git to push, commit, and pull
