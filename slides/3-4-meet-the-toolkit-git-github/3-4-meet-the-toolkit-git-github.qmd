-   It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one

-   Git is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word, on steroids

-   GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better

-   We will use GitHub as a platform for your course projects

## Tour Recap 

Create a GitHub account

-   Go to [Github](https://github.com/) and walk through the steps for creating an account.

-   Youâ€™ll need to choose a user name. I recommend reviewing the user name advice [here](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct#username-advice) before choosing a username.

## Tour Recap

-   Get a personal access token (PAT): `usethis::create_github_token()`

-   Copy your PAT 

-   Insert PAT to configure Git, GitHub and R `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

```
> gitcreds::gitcreds_set()

? Enter password or token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
-> Adding new credentials...
-> Removing credentials from cache...
-> Done.
```

## Git and GitHub tips

::: incremental
-   There are many many git commands ... but very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to push, commit, and pull

-   If you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line.
