-   Git is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word, on steroids
-   It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one

-   GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better

-   We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration (and as our course management system!)

## Git and GitHub tips {.smaller}

-   We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio, but if you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line.
-   There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/). Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.
